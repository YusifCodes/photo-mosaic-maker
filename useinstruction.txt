Hey there, welcome to my python photo mosaic maker using cv2 and PIL.

I will shortly describe how you should use this mosaic make.

First of all you have to provide a picture you want to make a mosaic out of.
You should put this image into the "res" folder (There will be a default placeholder image, just in case).

After completing the first step you can now call the "mosaicMake" function. You should provide a chopsize (The width and the height of the tile, I personally don't recommend going below 10, otherwise takes a lot of time.) and you should also provide the path to the image in the "res" folder. After that you are good to go.

The code works in a way that it splits an image into chopsize-sized tiles, then pushes the tiles to "cropped_img" folder.
After that the cropped images get processed in a way, where there is a block created with a solid average color of the corresponding tile, and after that this block gets pushed to "solid_blocks" folder.
And The last part, which is bulding the mosaic from these solid blocks using cv2.hconcat and cv2.vconcat.

The "cropped_img" and "solid_blocks" clean themselves when calling "makeMosaic" and at the end of the function too.

Be very careful if you decide to alter the code as it can result in images going into wrong folders.
